1. Take one molecular dataset and phenotype dataset
2. Transpose the molecular dataset
3. Select traget features from phenotype dataset
4. Merge the two datasets
5. Convert object types to numeric types
6. Feature selection - Information Gain (Mutual info), Correlation Coefficient, Chi-Square, Feature Importance - 25, 50, 100, 150, 200
7. Check cross-validation scores for each feature selection method with different number of features
8. Select the best feature selection method
9. Create new datasets (Feature counts 1-Instances_Count)
10. Bouild models with different feature counts - SVM(linear), SVM(poly), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, ANN, XGBoost
11. Check cross-validation scores for each model with different number of features
12. Select the best model and feature count
13. Measure accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, auc, roc, confusion matrix
14. Hyperparameter tuning for the best model
15. Result interpretation
16. Follow the same steps for other datasets
17. Compare the results
