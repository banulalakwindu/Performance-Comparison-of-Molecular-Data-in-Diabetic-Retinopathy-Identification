1. Take one molecular dataset and phenotype dataset
2. Transpose the molecular dataset
3. Select traget features from phenotype dataset
4. Merge the two datasets
5. Convert object types to numeric types
6. Feature selection - Information Gain (Mutual info), Correlation Coefficient, Chi-Square, Feature Importance - 25, 50, 100, 150, 200
7. Check cross-validation scores for each feature selection method with different number of features
8. Select the Best Feature Selection Method using Random Forest
9. Create new datasets (Feature counts 1-Instances_Count)
10. Bouild models with different feature counts - SVM(linear), SVM(poly), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, ANN, XGBoost
11. Check cross-validation scores for each model with different number of features
12. Select the best model and feature count
13. If the Best Model is not Random Forest, Follow Steps from 8 using Selected Best Algorithm
14. Measure accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, auc, roc, confusion matrix
15. Hyperparameter tuning for the best model
16. Result interpretation
17. Follow the same steps for other datasets
18. Compare the results
