Litrearature review: A critical review on diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy
using machine learning and deep learning
 This paper is published on 2022. This paper is critical review on diagnosis of DR using ML and DL techniques.
this paper aim is to review and analyze the current state of the art methods for diagnosis DR using ML & DL.
Limitation of this research is existing approaches using ML & DL are discussed.

Literature review: Automated diabetic retinopathy detection using radial basis function
Move to next research paper is "-----
this paper is published on 2020.
this research paper goal is to automatically detect retinal images as Non_DR or DR based on a RBFNN classifier. 
Here, they used to two database DIARETDB0 & DIARETDB1, these are standard DR Databases.
This research aim to save ophthalmologists' time and provide affortable earl detection---------
page10 
The proposed system achieved the 0.943 Sensitivity, 0.16 Specificity and 0.894 accuracy for DIARETDB1 and 
0.830 Sensitivity, 0.043 Specificity & 0.712 accuracy for DIARETDB0 shown in table.

Gap in the literature:
The research paper "Automted----" we selected for the research gap. 
DR is a complication of diabetes. Current situation, they are used to retinal images for identify the diagnosis.--------
And, The retinal images are used in detecting DR may heavily rely on the quality and clarity for the performance. 
Then, This research paper has several limitation, first thing here used a small sample size database, and a single type of neural network.


In our research:


Data to be used:

"Alterations of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosines": This refers to changes or modifications that occur in a specific type of DNA base called cytosine.
"Circulating Cell-free DNA": DNA is the genetic material present in cells, but it can also be found outside of cells in various body fluids such as blood. Circulating cell-free DNA refers to fragments of DNA that are released into the bloodstream or other body fluids when cells die and break down. These fragments are not contained within intact cells.
"Retinopathy in Type 2 Diabetes": Retinopathy is a condition that affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is a complication commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, which is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels.

 It involves studying the transcriptome, which is the complete set of RNA molecules transcribed from the genes in a cell or tissue. In this context, "in-depth transcriptomic analyses" means conducting comprehensive and detailed investigations into gene expression patterns and changes in the context of diabetic retinopathy.
RNA sequencing, is a high-throughput sequencing technique used to analyze the transcriptome of a biological sample. It provides a comprehensive and quantitative measurement of RNA molecules present in a sample, allowing researchers to study gene expression and transcriptomic profiles.
  Total RNA: Total RNA refers to the entirety of RNA molecules present in a biological sample, such as a tissue or cell. It includes all types of RNA, including messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA), among others.
Small RNA: Small RNA refers to a specific class of short RNA molecules, typically ranging from 20 to 200 nucleotides in length. Small RNA molecules have diverse functions and play important roles in regulating gene expression and various cellular processes.
