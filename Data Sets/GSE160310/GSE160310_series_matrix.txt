!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1	"Post-mortem human eyes from 43 donors were obtained through the Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Coralville, IA) after written informed consent of the next-of-kin was obtained and preserved within 6 hours post-mortem. Donors were categorized into one of four disease groups: a) diabetic donors with no apparent visual impairment or visible pathology of the retina at last eye exam, b) donors diagnosed with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) but without diabetic macular edema (DME), c) patients diagnosed with NPDR with additional indication of DME, or d) donors diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME. The diagnosis was based on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (ETDRS-DRSS). Additional retinal samples were taken from healthy donors to serve as the control group. The study was designed such that donors of all groups approximately matched in age and gender distribution. Note that none of the donors received treatment for their retinal indication. The study design was reviewed by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board and found not to involve human subjects research. From each donor group (healthy control, diabetic, NPPR, and NPDR/PDR + DME), 10 tissue samples were collected from the macula region as well as the retinal periphery. All tissue samples were taken with a 6mm biopsy punch, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80C until use. Both miRNA and total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) after homogenization of the retina with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 30 μl of dH2O.

"Post-mortem human eyes from 43 donors were obtained through the Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Coralville, IA) after written informed consent of the next-of-kin was obtained and preserved within 6 hours post-mortem. Donors were categorized into one of four disease groups: a) diabetic donors with no apparent visual impairment or visible pathology of the retina at last eye exam, b) donors diagnosed with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) but without diabetic macular edema (DME), c) patients diagnosed with NPDR with additional indication of DME, or d) donors diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME. The diagnosis was based on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (ETDRS-DRSS).

Additional retinal samples were taken from healthy donors to serve as the control group. The study was designed such that donors of all groups approximately matched in age and gender distribution. Note that none of the donors received treatment for their retinal indication. The study design was reviewed by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board and found not to involve human subjects research. From each donor group (healthy control, diabetic, NPPR, and NPDR/PDR + DME), 10 tissue samples were collected from the macula region as well as the retinal periphery. All tissue samples were taken with a 6mm biopsy punch, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80C until use. Both miRNA and total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) after homogenization of the retina with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 30 μl of dH2O. RNA was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using the fluorescence-based Broad Range Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and the Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis DNF-471 Kit on a 48-channel Fragment Analyzer (Agilent), respectively. Concentrations averaged at 100ng/µL while RIN ranged from 4 to 9."

"Post-mortem human eyes from 43 donors were obtained through the Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Coralville, IA) after written informed consent of the next-of-kin was obtained and preserved within 6 hours post-mortem. Donors were categorized into one of four disease groups: a) diabetic donors with no apparent visual impairment or visible pathology of the retina at last eye exam, b) donors diagnosed with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) but without diabetic macular edema (DME), c) patients diagnosed with NPDR with additional indication of DME, or d) donors diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME. The diagnosis was based on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (ETDRS-DRSS).

Additional retinal samples were taken from healthy donors to serve as the control group. The study was designed such that donors of all groups approximately matched in age and gender distribution. Note that none of the donors received treatment for their retinal indication. The study design was reviewed by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board and found not to involve human subjects research. From each donor group (healthy control, diabetic, NPPR, and NPDR/PDR + DME), 10 tissue samples were collected from the macula region as well as the retinal periphery. All tissue samples were taken with a 6mm biopsy punch, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80C until use. Both miRNA and total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) after homogenization of the retina with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 30 μl of dH2O. RNA was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using the fluorescence-based Broad Range Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and the Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis DNF-471 Kit on a 48-channel Fragment Analyzer (Agilent), respectively. Concentrations averaged at 100ng/µL while RIN ranged from 4 to 9."

"Post-mortem human eyes from 43 donors were obtained through the Iowa Lions Eye Bank (Coralville, IA) after written informed consent of the next-of-kin was obtained and preserved within 6 hours post-mortem. Donors were categorized into one of four disease groups: a) diabetic donors with no apparent visual impairment or visible pathology of the retina at last eye exam, b) donors diagnosed with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) but without diabetic macular edema (DME), c) patients diagnosed with NPDR with additional indication of DME, or d) donors diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and DME. The diagnosis was based on the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score (ETDRS-DRSS).

Additional retinal samples were taken from healthy donors to serve as the control group. The study was designed such that donors of all groups approximately matched in age and gender distribution. Note that none of the donors received treatment for their retinal indication. The study design was reviewed by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board and found not to involve human subjects research. From each donor group (healthy control, diabetic, NPPR, and NPDR/PDR + DME), 10 tissue samples were collected from the macula region as well as the retinal periphery. All tissue samples were taken with a 6mm biopsy punch, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80C until use. Both miRNA and total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) after homogenization of the retina with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 30 μl of dH2O. RNA was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using the fluorescence-based Broad Range Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and the Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis DNF-471 Kit on a 48-channel Fragment Analyzer (Agilent), respectively. Concentrations averaged at 100ng/µL while RIN ranged from 4 to 9."

All tissue samples were taken with a 6mm biopsy punch, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and preserved at -80C until use. Both miRNA and total RNA was extracted using miRNeasy kits (Qiagen) after homogenization of the retina with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was eluted into 30 μl of dH2O. RNA was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed using the fluorescence-based Broad Range Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) and the Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis DNF-471 Kit on a 48-channel Fragment Analyzer (Agilent), respectively. Concentrations averaged at 100ng/µL while RIN ranged from 4 to 9."
